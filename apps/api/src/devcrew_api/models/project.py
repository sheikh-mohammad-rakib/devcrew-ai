"""SQLAlchemy ORM model for the ``Project`` aggregate.

A Project belongs to exactly one :class:`Workspace` and represents a
bounded piece of work inside that workspace (e.g. "Refactor billing
service", "Q3 mobile release"). Projects are the second-tier container
in the DevCrew hierarchy:

    Workspace 1 ──── N Projects

This module defines ONLY the Project table and its relationship back
to :class:`Workspace`. There are no service-layer glue, no business
logic — those concerns live in their own modules.

Design notes
------------
* Inherits :class:`UUIDPrimaryKeyMixin` so every project has a
  globally-unique UUID v4 identifier (URL-safe, no integer-enumeration
  leaks).
* Inherits :class:`TimestampMixin` so every row carries ``created_at``
  and ``updated_at`` populated by the database.
* ``workspace_id`` is a server-side ``ForeignKey`` to ``workspaces.id``
  with ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` — deleting a workspace drops its
  projects. We treat a Project as part of its Workspace's data; we
  don't expect to keep orphan projects around.
* ``name`` is required and capped at 100 characters, matching the
  Workspace convention so cross-feature UI lists align.
* ``description`` is optional, unlimited-length ``Text``.
* ``status`` is a Python :class:`~enum.Enum` backed by a native
  PostgreSQL ``ENUM`` (so the database enforces the allowed values).
  See :class:`ProjectStatus`.
* The inverse relationship on :class:`Workspace` is exposed via
  ``Workspace.projects`` and uses ``cascade="all, delete-orphan"`` so
  removing a project from a workspace's collection deletes the row.
